jQPlaceholder
================================

A jQuery plugin to simulate the placeholder effect on older browsers.

Created by Pedro Chaves

## USAGE:

Place your "placeholder" attribute normally on your input tags, and then execute the code

```javascript
$('input[placeholder]').jQPlaceholder();
```

You can also use it simply by using

```javascript    
$.jQPlaceholder();
```
	
If you use the second one, the plugin will search for inputs with the placeholder attribute
and initialize them by itself.
