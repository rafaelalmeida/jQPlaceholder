jQPlaceholder

A jQuery plugin to simulate the placeholder effect on older browsers

Created by
Pedro Chaves

USAGE:
Place your "placeholder" attribute normally on your input tags, and then execute the code

    $('input[placeholder]').jQPlaceholder();

You can also use it simply by typing
    
	$.jQPlaceholder();
	
If you use the second one, the plugin will search for the inputs with the placeholder attribute
and inicialize them by himself.
